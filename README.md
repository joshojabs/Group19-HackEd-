# Gluca - Hacked 2026 💻

Gluca is a web appliation designed at the TechEducators HackED Norwich 2026 event. Gluca was designed to help those with diabetes to effectively manage their blood sugar levels, and aquire resources such as food recipes or recommendations through personalised resource and less clinnical style resource.

Gluca was designed through the problem statements:

"Blood sugar panic inhibits the ability for diabetics to make informed dietary choices"

"Knowledge around how different foods impact glucose, and making decisions around food are major pain points in day-to-day management of diabetes, and that there are a lot of feelings of fear or guilt attached to this."

## Why This Exists ❓

Through our research and communication within our team, we noticed that many people who are diagnosed at a young age as well as those with who have diabetes feel that there is not enough resources to mange and maintain a healty lifestyle with diabetes.

We also found with our research that because of the lack of resources, people feel overwhelmed, isolated and cannot continue with daily activites.
