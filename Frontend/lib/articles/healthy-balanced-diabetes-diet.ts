      heading: "Introduction — Why diet affects glucose and energy",
      content:
        "Carbohydrates in food become glucose in the blood. The type and amount you eat influence how quickly glucose rises and how long energy lasts. That matters for short-term glucose management and for long-term heart and weight health. A balanced approach focuses on portion awareness, steady energy, and including a variety of nutrients rather than strict bans.",

    {
      heading: "Fruit & Vegetables",
      content:
        "Fruit and vegetables add vitamins, minerals and fibre while helping you feel full. Fresh, frozen, canned (in water) and dried forms all count, though whole fruit keeps more fibre than juices. Include different colours across the day — aim for about five palm-sized portions — and choose lower‑carb fruit and veg when you need tighter carb control (berries, leafy greens, peppers, zucchini).",
    },
    {
      heading: "Gluca Tip",
      content:
        "Choose whole fruit over juice and pair fruit with a small protein or nut portion to slow the glucose rise after eating.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Starchy Carbohydrates",
      content:
        "Starchy foods (bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, noodles) are key fuel — they contain carbohydrate, which affects glucose. Prefer wholegrain or lower glycaemic index (GI) options where you can: oats, wholegrain bread, basmati rice and wholewheat pasta tend to raise glucose more slowly and provide more fibre. That can help steadier energy and support heart health. If reducing carbs, shrink portion sizes first rather than eliminating whole groups.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Low vs. high glycaemic index — a short guide",
      content:
        "GI is a simple way to describe how quickly a carbohydrate raises blood glucose. Low‑GI foods usually lead to slower, smaller glucose rises; high‑GI foods raise glucose faster. Use GI as one tool alongside portion size and fibre content — and always check how your own glucose responds.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Protein Foods",
      content:
        "Protein helps maintain muscle and keeps meals satisfying. Include beans, pulses, eggs, fish, poultry or lean meat across the week. Oily fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel) contains heart‑protective fats — aim for a couple of portions of oily fish weekly if you like it. Plant proteins (beans, lentils, tofu) add fibre and are great for mixing into soups, salads and one‑pot meals.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Dairy & Alternatives",
      content:
        "Milk, yoghurt and cheese are useful sources of calcium and protein. If you use plant milks, pick unsweetened, calcium‑fortified versions. Watch for added sugars in flavoured yoghurts — plain or natural yoghurt with fresh fruit is an easy swap. Dairy choices can be part of balanced meals while supporting bone and muscle health.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Oils & Fats",
      content:
        "We need some fat for energy and nutrient absorption. Focus on unsaturated fats (olive, rapeseed, nut butters, oily fish). Cut down on saturated fats (butter, lard, coconut oil) where possible to protect cholesterol and heart health. A small drizzle of olive oil, a handful of nuts, or a smear of nut butter can add flavour and keep you satisfied.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Foods High in Sugar, Salt & Saturated Fat",
      content:
        "Treat foods (sweets, cakes, crisps, sugary drinks) are often high in calories and can push glucose up quickly. They’re fine occasionally, but not part of daily balance. Try to cook more from scratch so you control salt and sugar, use herbs and spices for flavour, and choose water or unsweetened drinks most of the time. Reducing these foods helps weight and heart health without moralising choices.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Portion Awareness",
      content:
        "Portions have a big effect on glucose and energy. A useful rule: aim for a plate with roughly half vegetables, a quarter starchy carbohydrate and a quarter protein. Small changes — a slightly smaller bowl of rice or an extra handful of salad — can make glucose easier to manage while keeping meals satisfying.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Gluca Tip",
      content:
        "Use your palm as a quick portion guide: one palm of starchy food, one palm of protein, and two palms of veg for most meals.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Practical Daily Tips",
      content:
        "- Start the day with protein and fibre (porridge with seeds, or eggs with vegetables) to support steady energy.\n- Pair carbohydrates with protein or healthy fat to slow absorption (e.g., toast with nut butter and berries).\n- Keep a stash of easy, balanced snacks (plain yoghurt, a small handful of nuts, chopped veg with hummus) to avoid energy dips.\n- When eating out, choose wholegrain sides, extra veg and lean protein where possible.\n- Watch portion size more than forbidding food groups — consistency beats perfection.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Summary — What a balanced plate looks like",
      content:
        "A simple everyday plate: half the plate non‑starchy vegetables, one quarter starchy carbohydrate (preferably wholegrain or lower‑GI), and one quarter protein. Add a small amount of unsaturated fat and keep portions of sugary or fried foods occasional. Focus on balance, variety and small, repeatable habits — they make glucose control and healthy living more achievable over time.",
